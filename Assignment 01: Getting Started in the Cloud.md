# Part 2: Short Essay Questions

### 1. Describe the kinds of services and applications you use in your daily life that might benefit from being hosted in the cloud? (Minimum of 3 different services)

I think that Steam would benefit from using the cloud because they have so many games and millions of people that download and purchase things from their store. Sometimes big games launch on steam and it goes down because so many people are purchasing the game. Netflix and Hulu would also benefit because at night im sure theres a surge of people at night that want to watch a movie to settle down. BestBuy during cyber monday and black friday would benefit, or when a new console or phone comes out. I'm sure they would get a surge of people and have to constantly change their site load. A game I play called valorant goes down a lot because of new bundles being released and so many people buying it.

### 2. Some of these might already be in-fact running in the cloud. Which ones do you think already are?

When switching to the cloud it could mean exponentially increasing the amount of servers you get at a time for the same cost. 
     According to Google's Perspective cloud computing is simply the way to go. Cloud computing is very secure and powerful. It puts anywhere from one hundred to thousands of computers together and basically makes a Mega Super Computer. It's impossible to get anywhere near this kind of power from a single laptop, let alone a computer. Data is also more accessible than ever with cloud computing. You can instantly get data and information. With a normal hard-drive or SSD, you're limited to  an amount of data storage but the the cloud, there is not a limit.
