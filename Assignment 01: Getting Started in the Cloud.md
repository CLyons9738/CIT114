1. Jack tried to climb a Beanstock but instead of a giant, he found a web application service.

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk saves tons of money. You dont need additonal resources, you only need to pay for what you use. It automatically monitors your web apps and gives you key metrics.
Elastic Beanstalk also has automatic updates for your web application. Elastic Beanstalk gets you started and handles the start of your app. Also handles the load balancing and automatic scaling.
